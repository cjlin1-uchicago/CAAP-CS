The --no-mouse option was added Thu Jan 30 15:41:44 2014 +0900
SHA is c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168

Commit Message:
    Add --no-mouse option to replace FZF_MOUSE_ENABLED

Process:
    Some options I tried:
        git log -S "no-mouse"
        git grep -n "no-mouse"
        git grep -c "no-mouse"
    (Taken from https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Searching)
    Possible issue: 
        I think those search for actual commands or code, but not commit messages.
        I wanted to try to narrow down my options by using -c to count the number of occurrences.

Solution:
    This task was completed with: git grep --log="--no-mouse"
    (Taken from https://mijingo.com/blog/search-git-commits-with-grep)
    I think this works because it incorporates log as the first option.
    Then, the grep parameter (?) does the searching.

Task 8
------
The differences between uncommitted edits and the last commit are revealed by:
    git diff readme.txt
More generally, the command is:
    git diff <file>

Task 9
------
First, we will remove mistake.txt from the local repo with:
    rm mistake.txt
Doing git status, we see that the following is not staged for commit.
    deleted:    mistake.txt
We now need to stage this change with:
    git rm mistake.txt
Doing git status, the following will be ready to be committed.
    deleted:    mistake.txt
Now, we simply commit the change and push it into Github. :)

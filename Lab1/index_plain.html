        Bananas. Yellow, ripe, and tasty.
        Don't you love a good banana?
        But don't you hate a green, unripe banana?
        Or even a disgusting rotten banana?
    </p>
    <p>
        The <em>Grand Banana Company</em> is a team of
        skilled computer scientists who developed an
        image-recognition program that will accurately
        determine the age of your banana and the
        stage it's in during its life cycle, as well
        as predicting the best time to eat your banana.

      Why Bananas?
    </h2>
    <p> In every home kitchen, restaurant, and
        dining hall, we encounter bananas. The banana is one of
        the most produced fruits every year. However,
        thousands of pounds of bananas are gone to waste
        every day. More specifically, bananas, along with other fruits,
        <a href="https://www.foodandwine.com/news/bananas-food-waste-supermarket">
        account for 50% of wasted produce.</a> Why?
    </p>
    <p>
        First, you buy unripe bananas from the store.
        Because they look unripe, you leave the bananas out.
        A week or two later, you come back and your
        bananas grow those nasty, black, blemishes.
        You peel open one and it's all brown inside.
        And so, you toss it in the trash.
    </p>
    <p>
        As you can see, we waste so many bananas.
        Sure, they can go in the compost, but
        wouldn't it be better if you actually ate it?
        After all, you paid for the bananas so you'd
        eat them, not use them in your yard.
    </p>
    <p>
        And thus, we, The Grand Banana Company,
        created the <em>NanaScanner</em> to resolve this issue.
        The app will effectively determine the age of a banana
        and determine the amount of time until a banana is ripe.
        After identifying the age of your batch of bananas,
        the app will send reminders and notifications.

        The <em>NanaScanner</em> is the pinnacle of human
        innovation. By using our service, we can reduce food
        waste and improve food security.
        <br /><br />
        Our app is available for free on the iOS and
        Google Play stores. The more users we have,
        the better the <em>NanaScanner</em> can make
        predictions about bananas just from images.
        <br /><br />
        To make predictions about your batch of bananas,
        open the <em>NanaScanner</em> app on your device,
        and it will turn on your camera. Make sure to
        give the app permissions to your phone's camera.
        <br /><br />
        Simply use the camera and scan the banana from all
        angles prompted by the application. In a matter of seconds,
        the application will display the banana's age,
        time left until maturity, and give an option to
        set a reminder.
